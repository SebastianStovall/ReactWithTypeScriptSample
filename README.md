# In order to generate a REACT APP WITH TYPESCRIPT:

* run this command ----->  create-react-app "app-name-here" --template typescript
* if you have react-app installed globally, you can omit the npx at the front, otherwise, include it at the front of the command


# Managing the tsconfig.json file:

* default config is good for most of what you need
* if you need es6 import/export, make sure 'es6' is enabled under the target key
